# Object-Detection-using-Python
This project utilizes YOLOv3, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to perform real-time object detection in images. The implementation is done in Python using the OpenCV library. The YOLOv3 model is pretrained on the COCO dataset, allowing it to recognize a wide variety of objects.
