# Real-Time Object Detection and Annotation Tool

## Project Overview
Developed a real-time object detection and annotation tool using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to identify and label objects within images. The tool downloads images from user-provided URLs, processes them using OpenCV and a pre-trained YOLO model, and highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels. Enhanced the visual output by including confidence scores and highlighted backgrounds for labels. This application showcases advanced computer vision techniques and provides a robust solution for automatic image annotation.

## Features
- **Image Acquisition:** The project includes functionality to download images from URLs, making it versatile and easy to use with online image sources.
- **Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the YOLOv3 model, including resizing and normalization.
- **Object Detection:** Leveraging the YOLOv3 algorithm, the project detects and classifies objects within images with high accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels, providing a clear visual representation of the results.
- **Annotation:** Facilitates the annotation of images by marking detected objects with labels and confidence scores.

## YOLOv3 Algorithm
YOLOv3 version 3, is an advanced object detection algorithm that is known for its speed and accuracy. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:

### 1. Single Forward Pass:
- Unlike traditional object detection algorithms that apply the model to an image multiple times at different scales, YOLOv3 applies a single neural network to the entire image. This single pass significantly reduces computation time and improves detection speed.

### 2. Grid Division:
- The input image is divided into an

ùëÜ
S√óS grid. Each grid cell is responsible for predicting a fixed number of bounding boxes.

### 3. Bounding Box Prediction:
- Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes and associated confidence scores. The confidence score reflects the probability of an object being present and the accuracy of the bounding box prediction.

### 4. Class Prediction:
- For each bounding box, the grid cell also predicts the class probabilities for each class. This enables YOLOv3 to classify objects within the bounding boxes.

### 5. Anchor Boxes:
- YOLOv3 uses predefined anchor boxes (also called priors) to predict bounding boxes. These anchors are based on the dimensions of objects in the training dataset, allowing the model to better predict varying object sizes and shapes.

### 6. Feature Extraction:
- YOLOv3 uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input image. It applies multiple convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes to capture different levels of detail.

### 7. Multi-Scale Predictions:
- YOLOv3 makes predictions at three different scales, which helps in detecting objects of various sizes. These scales are extracted from different layers of the network, allowing the model to detect both large and small objects effectively.

### 8. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):
- To remove duplicate detections, YOLOv3 applies Non-Maximum Suppression. NMS ensures that only the bounding box with the highest confidence score is retained for each detected object.

### 9. Loss Function:
- YOLOv3 uses a custom loss function that penalizes classification errors, localization errors, and confidence score errors. This loss function is designed to improve the accuracy of both bounding box predictions and class predictions.
